## Usage
This is best used on your Express routes.

const app = express();

const company = new Model("companies", "id", ["id",
  "name",
  "num_employees",
  "description",
  "logo_url"]
);

app.get("/", async function (req, res, next) {
  try {
    const results = await company.findAll(req.query);
    return res.status(200).json({ "companies": results });
  } catch (error) {
    return next(error);
  };
});

```

## BUGS
<strong>SQL-Injections:</strong> Currently, we are handling SQL-injections on external requests but they are not handled when you create a model/table class.

## Versions

(live) 0.5.1 - First working version

(TBD) 1.0.0 - Will better organize the code and handle SQL-injections when creating the classes.
